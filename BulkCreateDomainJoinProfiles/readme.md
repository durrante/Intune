## What does it do?
Creates Intune Configuration Domain Join profiles based on inputs from the CSV, e.g. groupId, policy name, OU, Domain etc. Useful for Hybrid AD join scenarios.

## Thank you
This script is largely based upons Niels great script: https://www.nielskok.tech/intune/domain-join-profile-intune-via-powershell/, I've made a few adjustments to allow for an 'foreach' statement based on an CSV import. Thanks Niels!
